# Interactive Transcript & Export Features

## Overview

The ElevenLabs Transcription App now includes two major enhancements:

1. **Interactive Transcript** - Synchronizes with audio playback to highlight words in real-time
2. **Export Functionality** - Export transcripts in multiple formats for different use cases

## Interactive Transcript

This feature synchronizes with audio playback, allowing users to:

- See words highlighted in real-time as the audio plays
- Click on any word to jump to that point in the audio and automatically start playback
- Follow along with the transcript as playback progresses

## How It Works

1. **Word-Level Timestamps**: The ElevenLabs API provides timing information for each word in the transcript, including when the word starts and ends in the audio.

2. **Audio Playback Synchronization**: As the audio plays, the app continuously checks which word corresponds to the current playback time.

3. **Interactive Elements**: 
   - The current word is highlighted in yellow
   - Each word is clickable, allowing users to jump to specific points
   - The transcript automatically scrolls to keep the current word visible

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **AudioPlayer**: Provides controls for playing, pausing, and seeking the audio file.

2. **Transcript**: Displays the transcribed text with individual words as interactive elements.

3. **Synchronization**: The app passes the current audio time from the AudioPlayer to the Transcript component, which then highlights the appropriate word.

### Data Structure

The transcript data includes:

```javascript
{
  speaker: "Speaker ID",
  text: "The complete text of this segment",
  words: [
    {
      text: "individual",
      start: 0.5,  // Time in seconds when this word starts
      end: 1.2     // Time in seconds when this word ends
    },
    // More words...
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Users can visually follow along with the audio, making it easier to understand and review the content.

2. **Improved Navigation**: Quickly locate and jump to specific parts of the transcript by clicking on words.

3. **Better Review Experience**: For editing or reviewing purposes, users can easily find and replay specific sections.

## Export Functionality

Users can now export their transcripts in multiple formats:

1. **Text (.txt)** - Simple transcript with speaker labels
2. **Subtitles (.srt)** - Industry-standard subtitle format for video editors
3. **WebVTT (.vtt)** - Web-friendly subtitle format for HTML5 video
4. **JSON (.json)** - Complete data including timing information
5. **CSV (.csv)** - Spreadsheet format for data analysis

### Export Feature Benefits

1. **Accessibility** - Create subtitles for videos to improve accessibility
2. **Post-Processing** - Edit transcripts in your preferred editor
3. **Documentation** - Save transcripts for meeting notes or references
4. **Integration** - Use JSON or CSV formats to integrate with other tools
