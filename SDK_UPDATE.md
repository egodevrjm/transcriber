# ElevenLabs Transcription App - SDK Update

## Important Fix: Using the Official ElevenLabs SDK

We've completely refactored the application to use the official ElevenLabs SDK instead of direct API calls. This resolves the 422 error issues we were encountering.

### Key Changes

1. **Added the Official SDK**
   - Added the `elevenlabs` package to the project
   - Removed custom API calling code that was causing errors

2. **Simplified Transcription Process**
   - Now using `client.speechToText.convert()` method from the SDK
   - The SDK handles all the necessary parameter formatting
   - No need to manually construct FormData and headers

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error messages specific to the SDK
   - More reliable error detection

### How the Official SDK Works

The ElevenLabs SDK provides a simple wrapper around their API. Instead of manually constructing API calls, we now use:

```javascript
const client = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: apiKey
});

const transcription = await client.speechToText.convert({
  file: audioFile,
  model_id: 'scribe_v1',
  tag_audio_events: true,
  language_code: 'eng',
  diarize: true
});
```

This is much cleaner and less error-prone than direct API calls.

### Benefits of Using the SDK

1. **API Compatibility**
   - The SDK is maintained by ElevenLabs and updated when the API changes
   - No need to worry about endpoint URLs or parameter formats

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - The SDK provides more detailed error information
   - Less chance of misinterpreting API responses

3. **Simplified Code**
   - Less boilerplate code for API calls
   - Focus on application logic instead of API implementation details

## Running the Updated App

The app requires the same setup as before, but now uses the official SDK under the hood. Make sure to run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

And add your ElevenLabs API key in the Settings section.
